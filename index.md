<h1>Digital Drone Collective</h1>

<h3>A partnership between Transport Canada and Code for Canada.</h3> 

<h4>The Code for Canada Fellowship program</h4>

<p>The Code for Canada fellowship program embeds digital professionals in government for a 10-month period. The intent of the fellowship is to show what’s possible when the latest methods in user-centered design, product management and software development are applied to serving the public.</p>

<h4>Who worked on this app?</h4>

<p>A team of three Code for Canada fellows worked with a Transport Canada developer, alongside two individuals from the Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) Task Force.

* Weiguang Xiao, Developer, Transport Canada Solution Centre
* Fatima Khalid, Developer, Code for Canada Fellow
* Jennifer Payne, Product Manager, Code for Canada Fellow
* Andee Pittman, Designer, Code for Canada Fellow
* Jeannie Stewart-Smith, Senior Policy Analyst, RPAS Task Force
* Olivier Bellehumeur-Genier, Safety Inspector, RPAS Task Force

The work of this core team was supported by a project panel, made up of individuals from a variety of disciplines, who helped by providing feedback and remove blockers. </p>

<h4>The Challenge</h4>

<p>The challenge for our team was outlined in our project charter, authored by Code for Canada staff, in collaboration with Transport Canada.</p> 

> “Drone operators—especially those recreational operators who are new to aviation—experience confusion and frustration when planning flights, conducting and recording site surveys, analyzing risk, and reporting incidents. As a result many operators are not flying safely and in a manner that is consistent with regulations. By prioritizing features based on research into the needs of recreational drone operators, fellows will build a product that makes it easier for them to fly more safely and in accordance with regulations.”

<p>Our target users are new recreational drone pilots, specifically those without experience with aviation. From user research, we learned these individuals often use their drones for photography, or just for the fun of flying. Many of these individuals have limited aviation knowledge, as well as limited knowledge of drone regulations.</p>

<h4>What we built</h4>

<p>We are built a tool (a progressive web application), to help these recreational drone pilots to fly safely and legally. The intent of the first version of the tool is to guide users through the process of conducting a site survey, one component of the new Canadian drone regulations, which came into effect June 1st, 2019.

We aim to provide users a trusted and comprehensive source of information around the site survey. In order to do this, we are building a tool that will help recreational drone pilots gain an understanding of what steps are necessary within a site survey, how to complete each step and why each step is necessary.

Our long-term vision is a tool that guides users through all the steps necessary to comply with drone regulations (Canadian Aviation Regulations Part IX), including those not part of the site survey.</p>

<h4>What did the research tell us?</h4>

<p>The top challenge found in research was helping recreational drone pilots figure out how to follow the regulations. 

> Recreational drone operators in Canada need to understand and be able to enact all the steps required between acquiring and safely operating a drone, and to understand the risks of drone flight because users want to feel competent, safe and legal when they are flying a drone. Users want to keep their drone safe and avoid fines. They want an efficient, free, understandable, comprehensive, trusted source of information.
However, for the sake of learning how to help users at scale, we needed to start smaller with one aspect of the regulations. Having a small, well-defined scope would enable us to prototype and test more quickly. The second most pressing problem we identified was a lack of support for the site survey. We thought this process, although a complex process, would be the most impactful to design with. It would ensure that the design could handle the most complex support. Had we started with the regulation of writing standard operating procedures, for example, we might miss the level of granularity needed in the information architecture for more complex topics.

**Problem statement:**
How might we enable recreational drone pilots to confidently conduct their first site survey?

**Product goals:**

* Instruction - guide users through the process of conducting a site survey
* Include the why - include information about why it’s important (relating to user goals of avoiding fines, keeping drone/people safe)
* Include success metrics - give users criteria for success. How will they know when they’ve done it sufficiently and would pass inspection? 
* Be a trusted source - including liability information and awareness, have Transport Canada branding 
* Provide access offline - the ability for offline capability to serve the remote nature of drone flying
* Ease - Makes the process of site survey manageable and easy for users

**Desired product outcomes:**

* Motivation to follow regulations through an understanding of why these aspects are important to safety and avoiding fines
* Success with following regulations from understanding instructions and receiving guidance.

**Design constraints:**

* Must be a digital tool
* Must be scalable to accommodate other “doing” pieces of the regulations
* Must allow users to conduct activities properly under the regulations, ie. no simplifying processes to meet user needs.
